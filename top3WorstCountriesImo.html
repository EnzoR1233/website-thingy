<font face = "arial">I know tourism is a big big thing, so I made a list that, in my opinion, gives you some countries to avoid and reasons why, if you disagree come fight me I've beaten a T-rex before. "How did you beat a T-rex you absolute retard?", like this, so first, it goes to bite me right? Nope. I grab it's teeth and spin onto its nose like a really cool flip in kung fu panda, look at it, and use my laser eyes, blinding it, it looks up in pain and flings me up, it sniffs me out and jumps to get me, quick time event right, I dodge-obviously- and use my super laser eyes, laser eyes but better, and it turns into cooked meat. Come fight me.</font>

<font face = "arial">Morroco is quite a poor country with poor internet access and few actually good food options. The only place I find worth going is Marrakesh, which is still way to crowded for comfort with really tight pathways most of the time. The only fun thing there, in my opinion, is the Sahara Desert which I was allowed to drive a quadricycle for about 5 minutes and that was it.</font>

<font face = "arial">Belarus' government is stupid in my opinion and it annoys me a lot. They're all buddy buddies with Russia, a very rich country, and China, a very rich country again, but that's it. And they're both against nato, which belarus is surrounded by, and they're a third world country that has a poor economy only not collapsing because of Russia's support. They dont even have anything for tourism, that's famous at least. And they don't even use their own language, yes Morroco kind of fits into that but they use their official language which Belarus doesn't, most of them just speak Russian instead of the countries actual language which shows their probably not proud of being Belarusian.</font>

Now you might think,"Why on Earth do you hate France?". Three reasons, the accent is so annoying to me it sounds so cocky even when they're not trying to be and annoyingly posh. Second, tourists, the capital of tourism, Paris, is obviously crowded, especially at the Eifel Tower, and that's just no fun at all. Prices are also really high in the city, as it's the capital of tourism and the country I'll let it slide, which wouldn't really be a problem if there were any toilets that costed less than 10 Euros or even just public toilets around the city, in shops if you wanted to go to the toilet you had to buy something, which was very expensive for what you were going to buy in most cases. Last reason is wine, some wine taste better with time and take decades or even centuries, for good brands, which just annoys me so much because it's the only one that does it, like you're not quirky just give it up.

That's it. If you really have any objections than come fight me because I am always right. Now yes you might think that Italians sounds similar to Frenchmen, which they kind of do, 'eliminating' one of my points. What I have to say to that is their food, it's so incredibly good, especialy their ice cream it's amazing, but I do think other countries have better food, and I also think their people are just annoying for the sake of it, might be an ego problem because of the Romans I don't know. If I were to rate them I'd probably give them a honourable mention simply because I find tourism there better, I have gone to both places-Italy more times so it might be a bit biassed but it's okay-and Italy just had more things to offer, French cuisine is also really boring, all I can think of is cheese, wine and croissants, and I only like croissants.
